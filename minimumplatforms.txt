Minimum number of platforms required for a railway
99
36

Problem Statement: We are given two arrays that represent the arrival and departure times of trains that stop at the platform. We need to find the minimum number of platforms needed at the railway station so that no train has to wait.

Examples 1:

Input: N=6, 
arr[] = {9:00, 9:45, 9:55, 11:00, 15:00, 18:00} 
dep[] = {9:20, 12:00, 11:30, 11:50, 19:00, 20:00}

Output:3

Explanation: There are at-most three trains at a time. The train at 11:00 arrived but the trains which had arrived at 9:45 and 9:55 have still not departed. So, we need at least three platforms here.

Example 2:

Input Format: N=2, 
arr[]={10:20,12:00}
dep[]={10:50,12:30}

Output: 1

Explanation: Before the arrival of the new train, the earlier train already departed. So, we don't require multiple platforms.

Solution:
Intuition: Take each interval of arrival and departure one by one and count the number of overlapping time intervals. This can easily be done using nested for-loops. Maintain the maximum value of the count during the process and return the maximum value at the end.

Approach: We need to run two nested for-loops. Inside the inner loop count the number of intervals which intersect with the interval represented by the outer loop. As soon as the inner loop ends just update the maximum value of count and proceed with the next iteration of the outer loop. After the process ends we will get the maximum value of the count.

Solution 1: Naive Approach 
#include<bits/stdc++.h>
 using namespace std;
 
 int countPlatforms(int n,int arr[],int dep[])
 {
    int ans=1; //final value
    for(int i=0;i<=n-1;i++)
    {
        int count=1; // count of overlapping interval of only this   iteration
        for(int j=i+1;j<=n-1;j++)
        {
            if((arr[i]>=arr[j] && arr[i]<=dep[j]) ||
           (arr[j]>=arr[i] && arr[j]<=dep[i]))
           {
               count++;
           }
        }
        ans=max(ans,count); //updating the value
    }
    return ans;
 }
 
 int main()
 {
    int arr[]={900,945,955,1100,1500,1800};
    int dep[]={920,1200,1130,1150,1900,2000};
    int n=sizeof(dep)/sizeof(dep[0]);
    cout<<"Minimum number of Platforms reuired "<<countPlatforms(n,arr,dep)<<endl;
 }
